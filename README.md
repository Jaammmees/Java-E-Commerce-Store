# E-Commerce Store Project

## Overview
This project is a personal endeavor, developed for fun and learning purposes. The goal is to create a functional e-commerce store from scratch. The project will emphasize backend development, utilizing Java and Spring Boot for creating robust APIs and managing backend logistics.

## Project Objectives
- **Learn and Apply Best Practices**: The focus will be on applying industry-standard practices in coding, system design, and architecture.
- **Explore Backend Development**: As this project is backend-centric, significant effort will be invested in implementing complex backend logic and integrating various backend technologies.
- **Implement Full-Stack Integration**: While the backend is the primary focus, the project will also include a simple front-end using React, demonstrating full-stack development capabilities.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: MySQL and MongoDB (dual setup to explore both SQL and NoSQL options)
- **API Documentation**: Swagger for API endpoints visualization and interaction
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Deployment**: Initially on Heroku, with plans to move to Azure or AWS for scalability testing
